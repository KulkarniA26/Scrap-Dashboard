# Scrap-Dashboard
This SQL script analyzes production scrap data from the AdventureWorks2022 database.

It identifies work orders that had scrap reasons recorded, calculates the total scrap count per reason, and computes the total incurred expenses (ActualCost) for each work order. The final output lists work orders along with their associated scrap details, total scrap counts, and total costs, ordered by the work order completion date (ActualEndDate).

Purpose: To provide insights into production inefficiencies by linking scrap reasons to work orders and highlighting the financial impact of scrap across operations.
Database Used: AdventureWorks2022 by Microsoft
